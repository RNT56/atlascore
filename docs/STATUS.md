# AtlasCore — STATUS (living board)

> **This is the shared coordination board for every session (human or AI) and every worker.**
> Read [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) and this file before starting. Update it at session close.

## Current phase

**Block B1 — DONE (2026-06-03). Next: B2.**

The B1 skeleton is in place and verified: the `src/atlascore` package, the Alembic harness, and
migration `0001` (the `vector`/`pg_trgm` extensions + the `source` table). **Done-when met:**
`make test` is green (26 unit pass; 4 integration skip offline) and migrations run — applied to a
real Postgres 16 + pgvector with an empty autogenerate drift-check, idempotent re-upgrade, and a
clean downgrade→upgrade round-trip.

The MVP is a single ordered backlog of 15 blocks (**B1–B15**). See
[`PROJECT-PLAN.md`](PROJECT-PLAN.md) §MVP for the authoritative list. Discipline: freeze scope
until the current set runs unattended for a month before adding sources or services.

## Done (2026-06-03)

- Planning consolidated into [`PROJECT-PLAN.md`](PROJECT-PLAN.md) (legacy `AtlasWire-Personal-Plan.md`
  renamed; conflicting build lists replaced by a pointer to the single B1–B15 backlog;
  `AtlasWire`/`atlaswire` renamed to `AtlasCore`/`atlascore` except one documented "Formerly AtlasWire" note).
- [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) agent operating contract written and reconciled to the canonical spec.
- Full `docs/` scaffold created: `STATUS.md`, and deep-dive `README.md` files under
  `architecture/`, `connectors/`, `schemas/`, `security/`, `compliance/`, `mcp/`, `runbooks/`.
- ADRs 0001–0011 plus `decisions/0000-template.md` and `decisions/README.md` index
  (dated 2026-06-03, status Accepted).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), `dependabot.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  `pyproject.toml` (uv; `atlas` console script), `Makefile`, and root project files.
- Canonical repository tree created as folders (with `.gitkeep`).
- [`../README.md`](../README.md) and [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) seeded.
- **B1 — repo skeleton + packaging + Alembic + `source` schema (2026-06-03).**
  - Repository git-initialized; scaffold committed; `uv` toolchain on Python 3.12 with a committed
    `uv.lock`.
  - **Packaging finalized → ADR [0012](decisions/0012-packaging-layout-src-atlascore.md):** single
    `src/atlascore` import root (on-disk path == import path; the `packages`/`apps` split is kept as
    subpackage names). `atlas = atlascore.cli.main:app`. CLAUDE.md §7 + pyproject + CI/pre-commit updated.
  - `src/atlascore/core` (settings/ids/clock/logging/errors), `schemas` (`SourceRecord` + enums +
    default-deny), `storage.postgres` (`Base` + `Source` ORM), and the minimal `atlas` CLI.
  - Alembic harness + migration `0001` (extensions then `source`); URL resolved from env, no secrets.
  - 26 unit + 4 integration tests; audited `.secrets.baseline`; ruff/mypy/pytest all green.
  - Adversarial multi-agent review run; confirmed findings fixed (CI integration-job exit-5 redness;
    detect-secrets CI flag bug; constraint-naming locked by a unit test; doc/nit clarifications).

## In progress

*(none)* — B1 closed. B2 not yet claimed.

---

## Next

**B2 — Source registry + default-deny policy + canonical source YAML (retention + freshness) +
CLI `atlas source validate` / `atlas source test`.**

Concrete next steps:

1. YAML loader: parse the canonical source YAML (docs/connectors §4) into `SourceRecord`, mapping
   `policy.*`/`fetch.*` into the `config` jsonb (round-trip per R9) and `credentials.ref` →
   `credential_ref` (env-key name, never a value).
2. Duration-grammar validation for `retention` (`Nd|Nw|Nm|Ny|permanent`) and `freshness`
   (`Nh|…`), and the policy enum / default-deny gate (refuse `unknown`/`pending`/`prohibited`).
3. `atlas source validate <path>` and `atlas source validate --all` (the CI `source-yaml` job
   target), plus `atlas source test <id>` (policy + reachability dry-run, no live network by default).
4. Source↔table round-trip persistence + a register/sync path; per-connector fixtures begin in B4.

**Definition of done for B2:** register an approved RSS source; `unknown`/`pending`/`prohibited`
refused.

Then onward through B15. Build-order dependencies to remember: **B7** ships `search_documents` +
the `audit_log` table + result caps; **B8** adds `source_health` + the freshness job +
`get_source_health` + the daily digest (`atlas health` / `atlas digest`). `get_source_health`
must NOT be implemented before B8.

---

## Known issues

- **CI jobs that depend on later blocks are expected to be red until then**, by design: the
  `source-yaml` job calls `atlas source validate --all` (lands in **B2**), and `make seed` / the
  smoke target exercise ingestion (B2+). B1-owned jobs (lint-format, typecheck, test, migrations,
  secrets-scan, audit) and the `integration` job are green.
- **Local `make dev`/`make migrate` need Docker** (Postgres 16 + pgvector). Docker Desktop's
  first-boot on macOS can take a few minutes; the verification used a throwaway PG16 container.
- `make test` runs the integration tests only when a database is reachable (they skip otherwise);
  run `make dev && make migrate` first, or `make test-integration`, to exercise them locally.

---

## Open questions

- ~~**Python import/packaging layout**~~ — **RESOLVED in B1** (ADR
  [0012](decisions/0012-packaging-layout-src-atlascore.md)): single `src/atlascore` import root.
- **OSS license at publish** — choose Apache-2.0 or MIT when the repo goes public
  (`LICENSE` is a proprietary placeholder while private).
- **Embedding backend + dim for the first deploy** — `EMBEDDING_BACKEND` = `local` |
  `openai` | `google`, with a fixed `EMBEDDING_DIM` per deployment (switching later is a
  documented backfill + reindex). The operator currently lacks a powerful machine, so a cloud
  backend is a first-class option; weigh that against the PII-egress note in the compliance docs.
- **`LLM_BACKEND` for summaries** — `local` | `api` | `none`. If `api`, set a hard
  `LLM_MONTHLY_SPEND_CAP_EUR` and prefer no-training / zero-retention / DPA settings; if `none`,
  `get_document_summary` returns only cached summaries (else `null` with a reason).

## Multi-worker / cross-session coordination protocol

Multiple workers and multiple human/AI sessions may touch this project over time. **This file is
the shared board.** To keep sessions continuing flawlessly:

1. **Before starting:** read [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) and this `STATUS.md`.
2. **Claim a work-area:** add a dated entry under **In progress** stating the area + intent + who
   (e.g. `- 2026-06-03 — B1 packaging layout — <name/agent>`). Do not start work in an area another
   session has already claimed.
3. **At close:** move your item to **Done**, update **Next** and **Known issues**, record any
   user-facing change in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) `[Unreleased]`, add one ADR per
   architecture-changing decision, and keep diffs minimal and reversible.

Operational invariants worth remembering: exactly **one scheduler** instance; **one fetch worker**
in MVP (per-host token buckets; a second fetch worker is refused until the documented
`host_rate_state` scale-up path is enabled); parse/enrich may scale out via
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. The control plane (health, crawls, policy) is CLI-driven and
never depends on MCP.
